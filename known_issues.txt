Pressing ctrl-v when the textarea is selected will not work.
Pressing ctrl-z when you want to undo fails

Pinned comments are still closed when a json is load (so also when browser refresh) should be open (pinned).

No support for workspace comments
Need to make a plugin with a good interface.
